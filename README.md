# Python-Repo-Assignment-2
Task 1:
This program asks the user to enter a number and stores it as a floating-point value in the variable "no".
It uses the modulo operator " % " to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
If the remainder is 0, the program prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.
The "if-else" statement controls which message is displayed based on this condition.


Task 2:
This program uses a "for" loop to add all numbers from 1 to 50 and stores the result in the variable "heehe".
After the loop finishes, it prints the total sum of those numbers.
